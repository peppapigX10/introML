# IntroML - Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

## About
Hi I'm Peperi. This is an interactive website I made showcasing what I learned about scikit-learn, a machine learning library in Python

Visit the site: https://peppapigx10.github.io/introML/

## What it Does
Using HTML and CSS this website demonstrates my current knowledge of scikit-learn. Users can explore different machine learning models via an interactive gradient box interface.
The site covers:

- Classification models (KNN, Naive Bayes etc...)
- Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest etc...)
- Key concepts in supervised learning
- Model selection and evaluation
  
## Features
- Interactive model selection via gradient bozes
- Clean modern UI design
- Educational content about ML algorithm

## How to Use
- Visit website
- Select machine learning model from gradient boxes
- Learn about different algorithmns and their applications
